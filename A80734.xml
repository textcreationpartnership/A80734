            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153152:3"/>this of <hi>London:</hi> I am humbly of opinion that the ſame may be more properly mannaged at leſs charge by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing method; and the Exciſe now rendred ſo compulſive, become a more voluntary duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That in reference thereunto all Judges now going abroad may have direction to return an exact account of the number of Inns and Ale-houſes in their ſeveral Circuits; which number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided from the ſum or number of pounds <hi>Starling</hi> each County now ſtands Lett at <hi>per Annum,</hi> I beleeve will be found to give a reaſonable product for each Ale-houſe to pay yearly.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That the former Laws Prohibiting all perſons to ſell Beer, Ale, Perry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cyder, &amp;c. without Lycence may be revived, and enjoyned to be duly executed; and that Lycences may be granted only to ſuch, and ſo many perſons in each County at ſo much <hi>per Annum</hi> as the Juſtices of Peace in the ſame County ſhall think fit and a point: unto whoſe aſſiſtance may be added a Commiſſioner, without whom nothing ſhalbe tranſacted: who with a ſervant or two at moſt may be ſufficient to mannage any indifferent County according to this method, at little charge in reſpect to what is now therein expended.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That the unequallity in the Trades and draughts of ſeveral perſons appearing the greateſt obſticle in this deſigne; I conceive may be rectified by the ſaid Commiſſioner, who making it his whole buſineſs, may inform himſelf by the former receipts, or by the People themſelves, that are apt ennough to inform him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what they paid the laſt Farmers; which together with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſaid Juſtices may enable them to put an equal eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate upon all Lycences, according to the quallity and trade of the Perſons deſiring them; who will not be unwilling to pay down a quarters rent, and give Bond yearly to be renewed, for the remainder</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153152:4"/>but will preſently be re-taken, and the revenue be thereby brought in voluntary, that now is paid with much trouble and unwillingneſs by the People.</p>
               <p n="8">8 That no Lycence granted to any Perſon may extend further then for what Beer. Ale, &amp;c. he ſhall ſpend in his dwelling-houſe; ſo that the Drink ſold at publique Fairs during the Fair time may not be colloured or exempted from paying Exciſe; which by the ſaid Commiſſioner and his ſervants may with much eaſe be collected.</p>
               <p n="9">9 That the ſaid Juſtices or any one of them together with the ſaid Commiſſioner may have power to command all Conſtables, and other Officers to be aſſiſtant unto them in their diſtricts; and alſo to lay a Fine or other lawfull puniſhment on often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders according to their demerrits: to be paid one Moyery to the State, and the other to the poor of the Parriſh where the offence is committed by which means the People will be made ſtrictly to obſerve the plain laws by them underſtood, and be freed from that of Exciſe often intrapping them, and ſo myſtical to vulgar apprehenſions.</p>
               <p n="10">10 That all common Brewers not ſelling within <hi>London,</hi> and lines of Communication by means thereof may be diſ-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged of paying Exciſe for all ſtrong Beer, or Ale; and a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be impoſed on ſuch as ſhall ſell to perſons not Lycenſed that uſually tapp out or retayle the ſame: and that in conſideration of the ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel laid on ſmaller Beer, the Brewer that will not compound may be made lyable to ſuch Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quarterly to be paid as two of the ſaid Juſtices and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner ſhall reaſonably calculate. Alwaies provided that any Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er finding himſelf Injured by ſuch eſteemation and ſhall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the teſtimony of another make proof thereof upon Oath before the ſaid Juſtices &amp;c. that then due allowance may be returned him accordingly.</p>
               <p n="11">11 That this way of management will not be ſo propper in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and lines of Communication, where the Brewer ſerves all that is expended; and from whom the duty will be collected at the leaſt Charge; but as to the Country duty the caſe is much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153152:4"/>different: for there Exciſe being paid promiſcuouſly by others as well as by Common Brewers, both muſt be kept to a ſurvey, which if exactly done, the one fourth part of the receipts will not defraud the charge: by which means both the former Commiſſioners and preſent Farmers have been enforced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with all in the Country at as good rates as they could: which in effect is the method here preſcribed, dearly paid for, and brought from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> for expedition over the <hi>Alps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 That what the Common-wealths revenue hereby may be advanced, I ſhall not preſume to eſtemate, but do leave it to better judgements: only ſhall ſay, that by this way of mannagement (which more fully may be Illuſtrated) I conceive all frauds practiſed by Officers will be prevented; beſides the expence of fifty thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> now paid in Sallaries be taken off, and the rents paid for Lycences (thought leſs then the preſent Compoſitions made with the now Farmers) will bring in more yearly to the revenue. But my deſigne being to enlarge on the Cuſtomes, and Forreign Exciſe: I Humbly ſubmit this, and return.</p>
               <p n="13">13 That the Cuſtomes and Forrain Exciſe if Lett to Farm, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe mannaged by Perſons Interreſſed, would both diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Marchants, and obſtruct Trade; for that the manner of placing Perſons to judge in that, which if but Implicitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, though the judgment given be juſt, yet will not be ſo pleaſing to the People, as that done by Perſons more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as thoſe put in to mannage the ſame properly for the Intereſt of the Common-wealth will be rendred.</p>
               <p n="14">14 That the ſaid Forrain Exciſe and Cuſtomes being dependent one upon the other might be reduced into one Intire Office, and be better mannaged by the ſame Comiſſioners and Officers, to the eaſe and accommodation of Marchants in their diſpatches, and the trouble to ſhop keepers and others in fetching of tickets (the cheefeſt cauſe of complaint againſt the duty) be prevented.</p>
               <p n="15">15 That all Collectors and receivers of Cuſtoms their Journal or day Book of receipts may ſerve as a charge to the Marchant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153152:5"/>for Exciſe, whoſe firm may alſo ſerve for bill of entry at Cuſtome houſe, and from thence be transferred to the Leger, which is all the trouble extraordinary, and both accounts are compleated, the trouble in this and all things elſe will be to both Marchant and Officer ſhortned, the accounts upon occaſion readier to be Examined; and many miſtakes and other inconveniencies that now happen between both be prevented.</p>
               <p n="16">16 That in order thereunto, in ſtead of the firſt buyer, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant may be made alyble to pay the Exciſe; who doth the ſame voluntary already, in all the out parts, and many alſo in <hi>London</hi> ſelling their goods accordingly.</p>
               <p n="17">17 That by making that a ſtanding Law, which is now ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently practiſed, and falls out often as Controverſies between the Marchant and firſt buyer, who (although by the Law in being) is lyable to pay the duty, yet the Marchant alſo ſtands obliged to ſee it done, and diſcharged upon his account (which trouble is in ſmall parcels of goods ſold, a greater inconvenience then the payment of the duty) many ſutes in Law would be thereby prevented, and the Marchant have more poſſitive warrant to demand for, and ſell, both the Cuſtome and Exciſe with his goods.</p>
               <p n="18">18 That in liew of the Marchants ſtanding lyable to pay Exciſe, four moneths time may be given him to pay for the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity he entred inwards, and paid Cuſtomes; regard being had only to Wines and ſuch like perriſhable Commodities; which if not ſold or exported within the ſaid term, then to have three moneths time more, and no longer.</p>
               <p n="19">19 That a certain allowance may be computed for <hi>Leakage</hi> of Wines, and other liquid or waſting Commodities, in favour alſo of Marchants, at ſo much <hi>per Cent,</hi> for three moneths: and no other allowance to be made upon any pretence whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="20">20 That the prejudice to the State for want of ſooner reduceing the Exciſe to a more certain method is evident; in that the ſaid duties of Exciſe ſet on Wines, Tobacchoes, and many other Commodities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is double as much, and in no particular leſs then the duty of Cuſtomes, yet as to the ſame Commodities it ever
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153152:5"/>came ſhort of bringing in as much to the Common-wealths Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue as the Cuſtomes hath by many Thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 That the Officers of Cuſtomes and Exciſe, are ſo farr from correſponding one with the other, or the one to queſtion that which might prevent a fraud to the others Office, (if it bring no profit to himſelf as ſervants of one Maſter ſhould do) that they are rather helpfull to cheat the State againſt each others Office, and the Exciſe man moſt villified, as though ſervants of two different Intereſts; which ſhews how unneceſſary and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtant one of them ſtands for the Publique good.</p>
               <p n="22">22 That a due regulation may be made in the Officers of the Cuſtomes; ſo that the inferior ones (whoſe truck as to the States Intereſt is greater then the Comiſſioners) may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to pay themſelves with bribes as many of them do: and the Commiſſioners go away with ſixteen hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> each, for attendance but three hours in the day.</p>
               <p n="23">23 That eight hours in the day may be allowed at Cuſtome-houſe free for all men to do buſineſs, both for Cuſtomes and Exciſe (that is to ſay) from eight of the clock in the morning till twelve, and from two till ſix in the afternoon.</p>
               <p n="24">24 That ſix perſons well quallified both for integrety and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be choſen for Commiſſioners: whoſe ſallary need not exceed three hundred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> each and that two of them by turns may alwayes be abroad in the ſeveral Circuits, Surveying the out-ports which cannot be two often inſpected; there being moſt frauds practiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the perſons of Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſioners improper for that truſt; it being the greateſt of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moſt apt for Corruption when referred only to a particular ſtanding perſon; there being none to ſupervize him: but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this method they will be one ſupervizers to the other.</p>
               <p n="25">25 That one of the remaining four Commiſſioners by monethly or weekly turn may alſo ſerve as a General Surveyor abroad in the port of <hi>London,</hi> without whoſe inſpection, or the inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one of the Commiſſioners at Cuſtome houſe no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Sea-wet or otherwiſe upon goods ſhall be allowed: alſo that bils of ſight may not be granted for the future for that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153152:6"/>under Couller thereof, and by the prejudice of the other the State is deceived of many thouſand pounds yearly.</p>
               <p n="26">26 That according to this regulation barely in the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſallaries there will be preſerved of what is now vainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, nine thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and the buiſineſs be better mannaged by perſons that will make it their whole imployment, who only are fit for that ſervice.</p>
               <p n="27">27 That a moderation may be had in other great Sallaries, fit alſo to be taken down without hazard of breach of truſt: and that more Competent ones may be allowed the Inferior Officers, in whoſe hands the greateſt truſt is repoſed: their opportunities being ſuch to favour the Marchants, who work upon their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, inſomuch that they often practice to deliver half the Ships charge, without the knowledge of the ſuperior Officers, for a ſmall matter to the poor Wayter on board, to the great prejudice of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="28">28 That by the preventing the afore ſaid abuſe to the State, a greater will alſo be prevented; and the greateſt hinderance and prejudice to Trade, now practiſed in ſaving Cuſtomes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the honeſt Marchant is under-ſold by ſuch unfair dealing perſons; inſomuch that he muſt either keep his goods by him, to his prejudice till the others be ſold and expended, or elſe muſt ſell it at the others price; which he cannot do, that truly paies the duties, without being a looſer by his adventure; eſpecially of goods that pay great duties: which is much to the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Trade, and worthy of conſideration.</p>
               <p n="29">29 That better inſpection may be taken to goods exported, which returns the half ſubſidy: ſo that more may not be repaid then was received inwards; which is now commonly practiſed by Marchants; to the great prejudice of the State: and no care taken to prevent the ſame.</p>
               <p n="30">30 That the Collectors and other Officers in all the out-ports may be governed alſo by the ſame rules, and ordered to attend their Office for eight hours in the day; keeping their accounts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch propper method as ſhall be preſcribed.</p>
               <p n="31">31 That power may be given the ſaid Commiſſioners to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Officers in the preſence of a Conſtable, by them to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153152:6"/>authoriſed, in the day time to break open any doore or other place upon information where Prohibited goods or goods ſtoln a ſhore without payment of duties are houſed: or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in caſe of refuſal that the refuſer may by law be made ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſome great forfeiture; which will prevent many frauds practiſed.</p>
               <p n="32">32 That power alſo may be given the ſaid Commiſſioner in caſe of frauds ſuſpected, ſo much practiſed by Marchants coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring the goods of others to refuſe entry, and not to permit ſuch goods to be Landed till oath be given for ſatisfaction therein, which if truly obſerved the Common-wealth by Alian Cuſtome may receive many thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> the more, from <hi>Jews</hi> and other ſtrangers; who by means of ſuch frauds here, are admitted into a like fellowſhip, which we are denyed abroad.</p>
               <p n="33">33 That alſo for an other expedient to prevent the aforeſaid Frauds and faylings frequently practiſed by many (Free-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who though they coullorably give but the valew of 6d for a hundred pounds worth of Forrain goods, yet will preſume to enter the ſame as their own, and ſwear it alſo upon a light occaſion; I humbly conceive it moſt propper to enact that all perſons whatſoever that ſhould either Export or Import Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in any Forrain Bottom (that is to ſay ſuch Ship or Veſſel whereof the Maſter and ¾ of the Marriners are not really naturally born ſubjects of <hi>England,</hi> that ſuch perſons and no other ſhould pay Alian duties: which will be of greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the State, the Nations Shipping will be thereby again brought in requeſt and increaſed; with more encouragement to the poor dejected Sea-men; who for want of imployment at home are enforced many of them to ſerve Forrain Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p n="34">34 That for further encouragement and to prevent the Alinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ships and Sea men, which probably will befall <hi>England,</hi> by means of an Act made the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> laſt by the <hi>French</hi> King: Prohibiting all Ships not there built to export any the Commodities of his Kingdome without Lycence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I humbly conceive it propper to be forthwith Enacted that any Ships not built in <hi>England,</hi> and whereof the Maſter and ¾ of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153152:7"/>are not <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as aforeſaid, Importing any the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of <hi>France,</hi> may here pay 20 ſhilling <hi>per Tunn,</hi> according to the burthen of ſuch Ship to be entred in Cuſtome-houſe, and receive accordingly.</p>
               <p n="35">35 That by Impowring the ſaid Commiſſioners alſo to refuſe ſuch Marchants entries as ſtand oblidged for goods four moneths before entred (untill he pay the ſame) will be alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many Thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> now loſt in bad debts, by ſeveral decaying perſons, whoſe practice is to take up the goods of other Marchants, and firm for the Exciſe; with intent never to pay the duty: but as the buiſineſs is now mannaged do upon pretence of Exportation or getting the Officers to return the goods un-ſold, and by not truly accounting once in two or three years (if at all,) runs high in debt to the State; who are paid at laſt by a beggarly apearance, or <hi>Non eſt Inventus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36 That to reduce all accompts into a fair method, and prevent ſuch and other the like abuſes for the future, all Marchants might be ordered to clear their accounts in two moneths for all goods Imported before the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>September</hi> 1657. the time allowed them to clear their accounts, by paying the one ſixth part; and that all ſuch as had not the benefit of that Act againſt whom no poſſitive proof can be made, may have their accounts ballanced to that time by remitting all which they ſtand charged for in the Exciſe books; which will be well reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, and the State not prejudiced by Marchants: for that moſt of what they ſtand charged with, is by forging of hands, and the like abuſes placed wrongfully on their accounts; who in reaſon ought not to ſuffer thereby; and that all other goods ſince Imported, for which the Marchant ſtands lyable, may be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſcharged untill a moneth before the date of ſuch ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; whereby will be brought in at leaſt one hundred and twenty thouſand pounds to help ſupply the preſent want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Nation.</p>
               <p n="37">37 That notwithſtanding all proviſſions yet made, many frauds are ſtill practiſed by <hi>Dutch Marchants,</hi> and others, in cauſing their own Ships and goods to be ſeized, and ſetting up preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded proſecuters in the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> who ſerve only for coullor:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153152:7"/>whereby the State is abuſed, and the penalty of an Act made in 1651. <hi>For increaſe of Shipping, and incouragement of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation</hi> alſo avoyded; to the great diſcouragement of the native Marchants and Sea-men: which may be prevented by giving the ſaid Commiſſioners power to examine the matter of fact, and grounds of ſuch ſeizure made upon oath preſently after the goods are ſeized; which if they find not ſeizable, forthwith to diſcharge; but if in their judgements either coullorable ſeized or really ſeizable, then to Exhibite a Coppy of the evidence given, with the information into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> by ſuch informant as they ſhall think fit: ſo that hereby the opportunity now given the Informant and defendent to comply as they uſually do againſt the States Intereſt will be prevented, and the evidence ſo oft wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forgotten by means of their long Correſpondency, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding each others favours, will be alſo preſerved.</p>
               <p n="38">38 That the manner practiſed by the <hi>Barrons</hi> of <hi>Exchequer</hi> and <hi>Atturney</hi> General to compound for ſeizures doth Incourage Marchants to make attempts of Stealing Duties, who having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo found waies to conceal much of their goods, and to procure the reſt apprayſed very much under the true valew; that when taken, they are but ſmall looſers by the adventure: which if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe were to be really ſold, and the ſaid <hi>Barrons</hi> only in caſe of equity to give the defendent releef in monies according to the proportion or ſum the goods ſhould yeeld, that then the owner would be ingaged to procure them ſold for the real worth, much more to the States advantage, the terrour be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to offenders, and ſuch abuſes the leſs Committed.</p>
               <p n="39">39 That this Honourable Houſe of <hi>Parliament,</hi> will when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhall permit, take the Book of Rates for Cuſtomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration; wherein by reaſon the Trade is now differing from what it was at the time of making that Book, many things are worthy of amendment, for that by taking down the great duties ſet on ſilks, and other fine Commodities of ſmall bulk fit to be ſtoln a ſhore, whereof the one ſixth part is not at preſent entred, many Marchants that now make it their uſual Cuſtome to ſave their duties, will not then hazard their goods, but make true entries; and the receipts be more improved on ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:153152:8"/>
               <p n="40">40 That by the Books of accounts for Cuſtomes and Exciſe if the ſame may be produced, ſhall be made appear that for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years laſt paſt the Common-wealths revennue by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might have been Improved (as it now may for the future) at leaſt one hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> upon the ſame goods entred in Cuſtome houſe: and that moreover by this regulation and by better inſpection the ſaid Duties may be alſo advanced to forty Thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> more; and all men dealt juſtly by; according to a moderate Calculation.</p>
               <p n="41">41 That ſeveral other particulars propper to be put is practice for preventing many other frauds in and about the mannagement thereof by the inferior Officers, whereby the Revennue might be alſo much improved is here omitted; as being more propper to be communicated to thoſe unto whoſe care the ſaid mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be committed.</p>
               <p n="42">42 That by reaſon of the Warr with <hi>Spain</hi> (a place which vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of our Native Commodities) with other diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Trade, now faln into the hands of other Nations, the Imports of this Nation for ſome years late paſt hath ſo much exceeded the Exports, that the plate (being the ſinnues of Trade) is drawn much away into Forrain parts; which if ſet at a higher value here would not only ſtop that current; but cauſe the ſtream to return with increaſe of Trade, alſo worthy of conſideration.</p>
               <p n="43">43 That Perſons undertaking to diſcover the frauds dayly practiſed by Exportation of <hi>Wools, Leather,</hi> and <hi>Fullers-earth,</hi> ſo much to the increaſe of Forrain Manufacturies, and decay of our own, together with the means how to prevent the ſame for future may be rewarded and ſo incouraged, that things of ſuch concernment to the Nation may not ly concealed and the poor People for want of work be driven to vehement extremities.</p>
               <p n="44">44 That by ſuch regulation the forgeing Orders and Tickets, whereby the State hath been abuſed, and ſtill are, with other frauds frequently practiſed between the Marchant and firſt buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be prevented; the Marchants coullor of being ſo much in Arrears as he hath been, (whereby the Common-wealth loſt five parts of ſix at once of all the Debts in the Nation) and no good way to this day found to make the Marchant truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153152:8"/>countable, will be alſo remedied; the Shop-keeper and others be alſo freed from the trouble of fetching Tickets, the Revennue be ſo as aforeſaid improved and brought to a more certainty, all the vulgar exclamations that the Exciſe ſo much obſtructs the Nations Trade will be alſo ſilenced, the Marchants by the Aſſent of the moſt knowing of them be better ſatisfied, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Officers ſo Obnoxious to the People be taken away, the Common-wealths charge in Sallaries allowed them of thirty odd Thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> be leſſned, and the buſineſs more quietly mannaged, to the content of all People and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Trade.</p>
